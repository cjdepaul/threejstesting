This is just a project I will be using to play around with three.js  
I will probably just create branches with different creations.

First project is a working solar system simulation with basic planets to learn the basics

Solar System Sim (WIP):
To move use wasd to move forward, backwards, left, and right
To move up and down use space bar and shift 
To change where the you are looking click and drag
This simulation is not perfectly accurate, but the main variables to change if you'd like to make it more accurate
should be simple enough to find.
